# LetterNeuralNetwork
A List Based Neural Network that categorizes a letter based on its list representation.
### File Overview:
```bash
  - LetterNNET.py        # Implementation file of letterNNET
  - main.py              # Main program file to use LetterNNET
   
   # Generated output files
  - H_Training_set.txt   # H data training set that is generated by the program
  - L_Training_set.txt   # L data training set that is generated by the program
  - Test_data_set.txt    # Contains random H and L list representations for program testing
                         # NOTE: The last list is NOT part of the test data.
                         # It is the list that specifies the correct letter class for each list in the test_data
 ```

## Useful Functions in LetterNNET.py


    1. generate_LETTER_Data: Generates letter list representations randomly and outputs it to a file.
```Python
def generateHData(file_name:str, data_size:int, num_noise:int):
def generateLData(file_name:str, data_size:int, num_noise:int):
```
    file_name: Name of the output file for the generated data.
    data_size: Number of H or L letter lists.
    num_noise: Number of distorted elements for each letter list. 
    
    
    2. build_JmSet: Generates a list of random values that is used to sample from the letter lists 
       when training or testing input data. The Jm set contains evenly 
       divided tuples of size tuple_size.
```Python
def build_JmSet(list_length:int, tuple_size:int)
```
    list_length: Must be the same length as the letter lists because we must generate valid indexes!
    tuple_size: Size of the evenly divided tuples.
    
    
    3. train_LETTER_set: Trains the neural network based on the letter list data provided
    by the data_fname file
```Python
    def trainHSet(data_fname:str, tuple_size:int, input_Jm=None)
    def trainLSet(data_fname:str, tuple_size:int, input_Jm=None)
```
    data_fname: Name of the ouput file containing the H or L letter lists.
    tuple_size: Size of the tuoles that are used for sampling from the letter list.
    OPTIONAL - input_Jm: A list containing valid indexes for sampling and training the neural network
    if one is not provided the program will create one automatically and automatically save it to 
    its appropriate letter class Jm_set list. 
    
    
    4. generateSample: Generates a random set of H or L letter list representations that will 
    be used as input for the neural network
```Python
def generateSample(file_name:str, sample_size:int, num_noise:int):
```
    file_name: Name of the output file for the generated data.
    data_size: Number randomized letter lists
    num_noise: Number of distorted elements for each letter list. 
    
    5. sampleTesting: Uses the trained L and H data to guess the letter class of each
    list presentation from the input file
```Python
def sampleTesting(sample_data_fname:str, tuple_size:int):
```
    sample_data_fname: Name of the file containing the input letter lists
    tuple_size: Size of the tuples used for sampling
    AGAIN ---
    NOTE: The last list is NOT part of the test data. It is the list that specifies the correct 
    letter class for each list in the test_data. If you want to provide custom sample data, make sure 
    the very last list is the sample_list containing the correct class letters where:
    0: represents L in the ith letter list in sample data 
    1: represents H in the ith letter list in sample data 
    len(sample_data) == len(sample_letter_list)
