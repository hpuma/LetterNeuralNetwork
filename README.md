# LetterNeuralNetwork
A List Based Neural Network that categorizes a letter based on its list representation.
### File Overview:
```bash
  - LetterNNET.py        # Implementation file of letterNNET
  - main.py              # Main program file to use LetterNNET
   
   # Generated output files
  - H_Training_set.txt   # H data training set
  - L_Training_set.txt   # L data training set
  - Test_data_set.txt    # Randomized H and L list representations for to test the program
 ```
